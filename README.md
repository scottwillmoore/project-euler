# Project Euler

These are my solutions to Project Euler problems that I have solved. To date I have completed over fifty problems working in bursts over the course of two years. I have never looked up the solutions to a problem and I encourage others to do the same! For the moment the problems that I have solved are insignificant in difficulty, however if the days comes whereby I am solving the more difficult problems I will strongly consider making this a private repository.

I use Python 3 as my primary method to explore and solve each problem, but also frequently employ additional tools such as Wolfram Alpha and Desmos. In addition, I often write around 1-2 pages of notes on scrap paper to understand and formulate a strategy for solving the problem. These notes are often a mess and I am simply to lazy to upload them into the repository.

All solutions are:

* Written in the latest release of Python 3.

* Formatted with Black.

* Self-contained and contain zero dependencies, except for the Python standard library.

* Named using the appropriate naming convention.
